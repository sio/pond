# Rethinking personal IT infrastructure

In a world of data lakes and azure clouds this is a pond. Small, cozy and
personal.


## Project status: personal sandbox

In this repository I'm slowly building a large software project,
learning new stuff and experimenting with new techniques and ideas.

There are no deadlines and there is no ETA for when this will be usable.
Project outline is loosely defined and probably only exists in my head
(there are also _a lot_ of paper notes - not published).


## Contributing

This project is not currently looking for contributors.

There is no license attached, and that's intentional. Effectively that makes
the source code view-only (allowed by GitHub TOS) with no other permissions
granted.
I intend to publish this under an opensource license sometime later.
If you would like that to happen sooner please create an issue.

I will be glad to chat about any other topic too
and invite you to open an issue for any reason whatsoever.
